# Terms of Service – Gramsci Blocklist

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By installing or using the Gramsci Blocklist add-on (“the Add-on”), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Add-on.

## 2. Description of the Service
Gramsci Blocklist is a Google Sheets™ add-on that helps identify and manage blacklisted phone numbers within spreadsheets. The Add-on scans the active sheet and compares phone numbers against a blocklist retrieved via an external API. Based on the results, the Add-on may highlight, mark, or remove rows associated with blacklisted entries.

## 3. Use of the Add-on
You may use the Add-on for lawful purposes in accordance with these Terms. You are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to process the data contained in your spreadsheets and to submit phone numbers for blacklist verification.

## 4. Data Handling and Privacy
The Add-on processes only the data contained within the active Google Sheet as required to perform its functionality. Phone numbers may be transmitted to an external API solely for blacklist verification. No spreadsheet data or phone numbers are stored, logged, or retained by the developer beyond the duration of the request.

Use of the Add-on is also governed by the Privacy Policy.

## 5. Availability and Modifications
The Add-on is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. The developer may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Add-on at any time without prior notice.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties
The Add-on is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of accuracy, reliability, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. The developer does not guarantee that the Add-on will be error-free or uninterrupted.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in connection with the use or inability to use the Add-on.

## 8. Free of Charge
The Add-on is provided free of charge and does not include paid features.

## 9. Changes to These Terms
The developer reserves the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Add-on after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
