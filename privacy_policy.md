# Privacy Policy – Gramsci Blocklist

Gramsci Blocklist does not collect, store, or sell personal information.

The add-on operates solely on data contained within the active Google Sheet in which it is used. Spreadsheet content is processed only to perform the requested functionality and is not stored, logged, or retained by the developer.

To determine whether phone numbers are included in a blacklist, the add-on may send phone numbers to an external API operated by the organization for which the add-on is intended. This network request is used exclusively for blacklist verification. No spreadsheet data or phone numbers are stored by the developer beyond the duration of the request.

The blocklist is centrally maintained by the organization and is not configurable by end users. The add-on is intended for internal organizational use and supports internal data review and list-management workflows.

This add-on is provided free of charge.
